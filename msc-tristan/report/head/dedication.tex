I am thankful for Andres, Damian, John, and the University of Cambridge's Department of Medicine for hosting me for this master's thesis. I am particularly grateful for Damian for the excellent supervision, for sharing a thorough reviewing mindset and for accompanying me to explore different methods. In Switzerland, I am thankful for Philippe, Martin, and Annie, for their continuous support during my master's at EPFL, through our discussions and the many advice in the projects we undertook together. I am also highly grateful for the CF clinicians and researchers from HÃ´pital Necker Enfants Malades (France), Arizona Health Sciences Center (US) and Royal Papworth Hospital (UK), for providing an expert feedback on my work. Eventually, I would also like to thank all Project Breathe collaborators for building the richest CF data set of high-frequency physiological measurements in history. I trust that it will help to improve CFers lives condition even further than the current multiple benefits. More personally, as a CF patient and a researcher, it has been hard but also mind-opening to discover the diversity of CFers conditions. Studying CF in the spotlight of the life-changing Trikafta CFTR modulator therapy introduction in Europe was therefore particularly motivating.
